# Gradient Boosting Machines Notebook Repository

This repository contains a notebook (contents written in Portuguese - pt-BR) where I am implementing and writing explanations about Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM). The aim is to explore the theory behind GBMs as well as their practical implementations, including techniques like Stochastic Gradient Boosting.

## Content

- Introduction to Gradient Boosting Machines
- Basic implementation of GBM
- Comparison between GBM and Stochastic GBM
- Performance evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV

## Objective

This notebook was created to provide a better understanding of how Gradient Boosting Machines work, both in theory and practice, through detailed examples and explanations.

## Language

All contents of this notebook are written in Portuguese (pt-BR).
